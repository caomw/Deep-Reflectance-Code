# Deep Reflectance Codes (DRC), A Hashing Approach for Material Recognition and Surface Friction Prediction

Created by Hang Zhang, Kristin Dana and Ko Nishino

###   Introduction

This repository contains the code for reproducing the results in the paper (coming soon)
Link to the [project](http://www.hangzh.com/Friction.html)

### Get Started

* The code relies on [vlfeat](http://www.vlfeat.org/), and [matconvnet](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet), which should be downloaded and built before running the experiments. 

* Download the models (VGG-M) in `data/models`. It is slightly faster to download them manually from here: [http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/pretrained](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/pretrained).

* Download the following dataset to data folder
    * Reflectance Disks (coming soon)  
    * Flickr Material Database [FMD](http://people.csail.mit.edu/celiu/CVPR2010/FMD/) 
    * Describable Textures Dataset [DTD](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/dtd)
    * Textures under varying Illumination[KTH](http://www.nada.kth.se/cvap/databases/kth-tips/)

* 'run_Experiments.m' reproducing general material recogniton results

*  'HashForFriction_Demo.m' reproducting friction prediction results
